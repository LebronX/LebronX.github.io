I am currently a senior student majoring in Software Engineering from Sun Yat-sen University and a visiting student with the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~andrewust/" target="_self">Yepang Liu</a> at Southern University of Science and Technology. I have been a visiting internship at the HKUST and my supervisor was Prof. <a href="http://www.cse.ust.hk/~scc/" target="_self">Shing-Chi Cheung</a>. I have conducted some research projects in static analysis tools and defect prediction. I like reading novels and spending time with friends and family.
